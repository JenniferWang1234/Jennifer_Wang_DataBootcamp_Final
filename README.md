### Regression Models Tested:
- Multiple Linear Regression Model
- Lasso Regression Model
- K-Nearest Neighbors Regression Model
- Decision Tree Regression Model
- Random Forest Regression Model
### Features Used for Modeling:
- Study hours per day
- Social media hours per day
- Netflix hours per day
- Whether the student has part part-time job
